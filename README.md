### CoverCarousel
A script to display book covers on large TVs (jumbotrons) using Alma and ContentCafe

## How it Works
Create a physical items set in Alma of any criterea (New books, books on a certain subject, etc.).

CoverCarousel reads the set and grabs the ISBN for each item and searches ContentCafe for a HQ image to display.
